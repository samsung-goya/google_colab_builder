# Google Colab builder for SM-T110/SM-T111

## Most time-consuming things
- Chromium *(this took 1-2 hours, painfully long, will almost be building the entire time)*
- LLVM *(took around 1 hour)*
- Clang libs *(took around 45 minutes)*
- V8 engine *(just around 30 minutes)*

Total build time is around 3-4 hours,
so get yourself a

and wait for the build to finish :)
